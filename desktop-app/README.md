# Configuration

In order to run the projects, there are some requirements:

1) Make sure NodeJS and npm are installed on the machine.
    Check by typing in the terminal `node -v` and `npm -v`. You should see the version if they are installed.
2) To install Angular run: `npm install -g @angular/cli`.
3) To install Electron run: `npm i -D electron@latest`.
4) Open the project and install all the dependencies
    Open a terminal in the project folder and type `npm install`.

# Run Electron
This requires ElectronJs already installed
To run the project via Electron use: `npm run electron-build`. This will build the Angular application in production mode and will open it with Electron
